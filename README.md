# nmapper_ultra
Nmap PyDumpPlus is an append-only, staged Nmap pipeline that discovers open ports, runs targeted follow-up scans (aggressive/service and UDP probes), and produces structured outputs (CSV, per-port/service files, and a simple HTML dashboard) to speed recon and keep results consistent across runs.
